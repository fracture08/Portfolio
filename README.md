### 🚀 Professional Summary
I am a Security Architect bridging the gap between technical engineering and high-level governance. With 4+ years of operational experience securing critical infrastructure and a specialized focus on **Zero Trust** and **AI Security**, I help organizations build resilient, compliant, and future-proof security postures.

This repository contains selected technical deliverables, architectural designs, and strategic reports demonstrating my competency in **AI Security**, **GRC**, **Cloud Security**, and **Network Defense**.

### 🧠 AI Security, Strategy & Architecture
*High-level design, governance, and transformation strategies.*

#### 1. [Zero Trust Architecture for Agentic AI (Research)](./01_Zero_Trust_Architecture_for_Agentic_AI_Research.pdf)
**Focus:** Zero Trust (ZTA), SABSA Framework, Emerging Threat Modeling
* **The Challenge:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) used by Agentic AI lacks inherent security, exposing systems to "Tool Poisoning" and "Puppet Attacks."
* **The Solution:** Architected a comprehensive Zero Trust layer using the **SABSA framework**, featuring dynamic policy enforcement (OPA) and cryptographic tool verification.
* **Outcome:** A validated blueprint for securely deploying autonomous AI agents in enterprise environments.

#### 2. [AI Security Transformation Strategy (Consultancy Report)](./02_AI_Security_Transformation_Consultancy_Report.pdf)
**Focus:** AI Governance, Azure Sentinel, SOAR, Risk Management
* **The Challenge:** ACME Finance required a rapid security transformation to manage risks associated with deploying RAG-enabled chatbots and Agentic AI.
* **The Solution:** Developed a "4D Framework" (Diagnose, Design, Deliver, Defend) to implement Azure Security Co-pilot and Logic App-based SOAR.
* **Outcome:** A £332k roadmap delivering robust AI governance, reduced attack surface, and GDPR compliance within 6 sprints.

#### 3. [Greenfield Enterprise Security Architecture](./03_Enterprise_Security_Architecture_Design.pdf)
**Focus:** Cloud Infrastructure, Identity Management (IAM), Defense-in-Depth
* **The Challenge:** A boutique hotel (Bletchley Grange) required immediate cloud infrastructure deployment for sensitive health/spa data handling.
* **The Solution:** Designed a segmented VPC architecture with One.ID SSO, MaxwellDetect MSSP integration, and strict GDPR data sovereignty controls.
* **Outcome:** Achieved operational readiness in 6 weeks with ISO 27001-aligned controls.

### 🛡️ GRC, Auditing & Technical Implementation
*Hands-on risk assessments, network engineering, and secure coding.*

#### 4. [Critical Infrastructure IoT Risk Audit](./04_Critical_Infrastructure_IoT_Risk_Audit.pdf)
**Focus:** OT/ICS Security, NIST CSF, Vulnerability Management
* **The Scope:** First-ever cyber risk audit for an airport's IoT infrastructure (Surveillance, Air Traffic Control, BMS) after 12 years of neglect.
* **The Findings:** Identified critical CVEs in Hikvision and Honeywell systems.
* **The Strategy:** Proposed a "Low Hanging Fruit" mitigation strategy focusing on network segmentation and immediate firmware patching to reduce kinetic risks.

#### 5. [Secure Network Segmentation Design](./05_Network_Segmentation_and_ZPF_Design.pdf)
**Focus:** Cisco IOS, OSPF, Zone-Based Firewalls, VLANs
* **The Build:** A complete network architecture for a distributed workforce (Tech Zolutions).
* **The Tech:** Implemented Zone-Based Policy Firewalls (ZPF) for traffic inspection, OSPF for dynamic routing, and IPsec VPNs for secure site-to-site connectivity.
* **Outcome:** Successfully isolated departmental traffic using ACLs while maintaining business continuity.

#### 6. [Banking Cryptography System (Python Implementation)](./06_Python_Banking_Cryptography_Implementation.pdf)
**Focus:** Applied Cryptography, Secure Coding, AppSec
* **The Code:** Developed a secure banking backend simulation in Python.
* **Features:** Implemented AES-256 (Fernet) for data encryption, PBKDF2 for password hashing, HMAC for integrity verification, and a simulated TLS handshake.
* **Outcome:** Demonstrated practical application of confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation principles in software development.
